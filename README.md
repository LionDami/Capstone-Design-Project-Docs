#### What Your Research Findings?
In the research of my key areas of the Saltwater-Powered Lantern, I found:
Saltwater Power Generation 
In the process of ionisation, it is possible to generate electricity from seawater. This is because the ocean's salty water acts as an electrical conductor, making it a source of renewable energy. Sodium ions and chloride ions are made up of salt molecules. An ion is the atom that's had an electrical charge because it has either gained or lost its electron, and therefore carries both positive and negative charges.
When you put salt in water, the water molecules pull the sodium and chlorine ions apart so they are floating freely, increasing the conductivity. It's these ions that bring electricity through the water with a current. Salt water, combined with sodium chloride, can also contribute to the production of electricity. [2]
I also found proof of concept experiments conducting experiments generating electricity from saltwater. 

#### Market Dynamics 
The electricity market report 2023 claims that the global energy crisis, worsened by international conflicts, has led to a sharp increase in the cost of producing electricity as well as a sharp price increase for necessities. Saltwater-powered lanterns are one of the creative solutions that are gaining traction as viable alternatives to traditional electricity sources as the demand for electricity continues to rise, especially in Asia. The lanterns provide an economical and environmentally friendly solution that tackles the financial implications of rising energy costs as well as environmental concerns. Adopting alternative energy solutions becomes essential for meeting the rising energy needs and reducing the strain on traditional power sources, as the demand for electricity is predicted to soar in emerging markets like China, India, and Southeast Asia. [3]

#### User Experiences 
Operating products is a way for users to achieve behavioural goals. Studying user behaviour can help designers identify the potential needs of users to explore more design possibilities. Through questionnaire surveys, target users are found to evaluate the functional attributes of the product, and the survey data are collected to determine the specific attributes of each function. According the examination of consumer preferences for solar portable lights report. survey indicates storekeepers were perceived to be the main demographic that would use the solar portable light All Night, followed closely by students and farmers. This product is similar to the Saltwater-powered lantern, so this shows me my potential user. [4]
#### Environmental Implications 
For the main source of the Saltwater-powered lantern  illumination, will be LED lights. LEDs or light-emitting diodes are much more energy efficient than traditional lighting sources and require less than 25% of the energy consumed by incandescent bulbs. [5]
Due to these reason LED lights have increased their popularity in recent years due to their energy efficiency and long lifespan. Comparing the traditional incandescent bulbs with the LED lights, we can appreciate that LED lights use a lot less energy, in concert 80% less energy, so it requires less electricity to power on compared to the traditional ones. This reduction also means a reduction in greenhouse gas emissions and less carbon dioxide released. Another benefit is that LED lights need less energy to produce, reducing the environmental impact they are also highly recyclable . Overall led lights are a step in the right direction for the environmental impact. [6]

### Environment Research 
Environment Research: Technology, regulations and business implications 20%
#### Technology
Saltwater power generation is possible through the process of ionisation. In salt, each atom of sodium is bonded to an atom of chlorine i.e. Sodium Chloride
**Here's how it works:**
1.	**Ionic Bond in Salt:** Salt, or sodium chloride (NaCl), consists of sodium atoms bonded to chlorine atoms through ionic bonds. In this bond, sodium donates an electron to chlorine, creating a slight positive charge on sodium and a slight negative charge on chlorine.
2.	**Dissolution in Water:** When salt is dissolved in water, the ionic bond is broken, and sodium and chlorine ions separate. Water molecules play a crucial role in facilitating this separation.
3.	**Ion Movement in Water:** The separated sodium and chlorine ions become free to move within the water, with sodium carrying a positive charge and chlorine carrying a negative charge.
4.	**Conduction of Electricity:** The movement of charged ions in the water allows it to conduct electricity. This is due to the flow of electrons as a result of the ionization process. [10]

To generate electricity for a lantern using copper, magnesium, and aluminium plates, you can set up a simple electrochemical cell. Here's a basic explanation:

1.	**Create an Electrochemical Cell:** Place copper and magnesium plates in the saltwater solution. Connect them with wires to create a circuit.
2.	Ionization Process: As the saltwater solution facilitates the ionization of sodium and chlorine ions, electrons are released in the process.
3.	**Electron Flow:** The released electrons can flow through the external circuit, from the more reactive metal (such as magnesium) to the less reactive metal (such as copper), creating an electric current.
4.	**Powering the Lantern:** The generated electric current can be used to power the lantern, converting the chemical energy from the ionization process into electrical energy.
This setup, often referred to as a simple galvanic cell or battery, demonstrates how the ionization of saltwater can be utilized to generate electricity for practical applications like powering a lantern. [11] [12]

### Regulatory Compliance 
According to the Electronic Communications report. The legislations I will be under is by the commission for communications regulation(ComReg). ComReg is a statutory body responsible for the regulation of the electronics sector. They are responsible for protecting consumers and to encourage innovation in the sector. So their role involves dealing with law, economics and technology. [13]
“Under the Communications Regulation Act 2002, Comreg is obliged to publish provision of electronic” surveillance and enforcement responsibilities in relation to regulation are. [14]
•	Ensuring that operators fulfil their obligations
•	Encouraging competition aids in the internal market's development
•	advancing user interests inside the European Community
•	ensuring the effective use and management of the national numbering scheme's numbers and radio frequency spectrum
•	encouraging the growth of the postal industry and, specifically, the provision of a universal service
•	defending the rights of final consumers of high-priced services [14]

### Business implications
#### Positive Business Implications:
•	**Market Appeal:** Having an innovative and sustainable product can help you stand out from competitors and increase market appeal. Eco-friendly products are becoming more encouraged and trendy by societies , this will give an competitive edge.
•	**Cost-Effectiveness:** While the lantern's initial cost may not yet be set, highlighting its long lifespan and rechargeable nature will draw in consumers searching for reasonably priced, long-lasting solutions. This will contribute to higher perceived value over time. 
•	**Government Incentives:** In regions where governments offer incentives for sustainable and renewable energy products, Saltwater-powered lantern will perform well as a result of more promotion and financial benefits.

#### Negative Business Implications:
•	**Initial Cost:** The initial costs of developing environmentally friendly technology may be higher. A way to address this negative and upscale the value would be quality.
•	Competitive Landscape: Examining the market to make sure saltwater-power lantern stands out from the competition. In any case there are any identical products on the market, in doing so will develop special qualities in lantern in order to stand out.
Overall, addressing these considerations will reduce unforeseen issues ahead road maximising the upside execution.
